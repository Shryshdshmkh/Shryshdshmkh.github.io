    Hi! I am a doctoral student at <a href="https://www.iimk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode</a>, specializing in Quantitative Methods and Operations Management. My academic and research journey is driven by a strong interest in applying advanced analytical techniques particularly statistical machine learning, spatial econometrics, and volatility and multivariate time series modeling to solve complex real-world problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research spans a wide range of domains, including demography, public health, sustainability, and hospitality. I am particularly interested in how quantitative insights can inform policy and improve outcomes in sectors with high social impact. In addition to my core research, I am developing an interactive data visualization portal focused on demographic and socio-economic indicators, with integrated GIS-based geocoding and mapping capabilities. This initiative involves working with granular data from the Indian Census, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), and other large-scale datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was a pre-doctoral fellow at IIM Bangalore in the field of Decision Sciences, under the mentorship of <a href="https://soudeepd.github.io/">Dr. Soudeep Deb</a>. During this time, I worked extensively on methodologies for predicting disease outbreaks and evaluated them using experimental and simulation approaches. Currently, my research focuses on quantile autoregression and its efficiency in predicting extreme values in time series data.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a dedicated researcher with a postgraduate degree in Statistics and a Master’s in Population Studies. My academic journey includes a Master’s in Population Studies from the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai; an MSc in Statistics from Sardar Patel University, Anand, Gujarat; and a BSc in Statistics from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Maharashtra. My academic background has fueled my strong interest in public health research.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my recent role as a Statistician and Junior Data Manager at Johns Hopkins India Private Limited, Pune, I played a pivotal role in supervising data management teams, developing clinical risk prediction models, and contributing to statistical analysis plans for complex public health and clinical research projects. Additionally, I have worked on numerous freelance projects, demonstrating my expertise in survey design, clinical data analysis, and the application of advanced statistical methodologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not at my desk, you can find me running, playing chess, or doing something fun outdoors!
