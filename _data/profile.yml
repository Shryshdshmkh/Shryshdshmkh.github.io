    I am a pre-doctoral fellow at IIM Bangalore in the field of decision science, under the mentorship of <a href="https://soudeepd.github.io/">Dr. Soudeep Deb</a>. Here, I have worked on developing novel methodologies for predicting disease outbreaks and evaluating them using experimental and simulation approaches. Currently, I am focused on quantile autoregression and its efficiency in predicting higher values in time series data.

    I am a dedicated researcher with a post-graduate degree in Statistics and a Masterâ€™s in Population Studies. With a profound interest in public health research, I hold a master's in Population Studies from the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai.
