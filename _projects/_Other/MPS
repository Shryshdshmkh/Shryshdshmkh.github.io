## Abstract

Infertility remains a critical but often overlooked public health concern in developing countries. This study examines the prevalence and risk factors associated with primary infertility among women in India using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019â€“2021). Primary infertility, defined as the inability to conceive after at least one year of trying, is influenced by multiple socioeconomic, biological, and lifestyle factors. The study employs Poisson regression analysis to identify key determinants, including education levels, caste, dietary habits, obesity, and anemia. Findings indicate that the prevalence of primary infertility has declined from 1.9% (NFHS-4) to 1.7% (NFHS-5), with significant regional variations. Higher education levels, Scheduled Tribe background, poor dietary intake, and short stature were identified as major risk factors. Despite declining trends, infertility remains a socioeconomically stratified issue, with limited access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in marginalized communities. The study underscores the need for targeted policy interventions to improve reproductive health awareness, access to fertility treatments, and overall well-being.
