  This study examines the consumption expenditure inequality across social groups of various
  states in India to analyze the disparities in the consumption of resources using MPCE. The Gini
  coefficient, a key indicator of economic inequality, is calculated. Our findings reveal significant
  variations in income inequality across states, with Maharashtra exhibiting the highest Gini coefficient
  at 0.3692, followed by Chhattisgarh (0.3571) and Haryana (0.3516). Conversely, states such as Manipur
  and Tripura demonstrate lower levels of inequality, with Gini coefficients of 0.2405 and 0.2408, respectively.
  Also, within states, there is considerable variation among different castes, highlighting the homogeneity of
  lower expenditure groups. The uneven distribution of wealth and resources across castes is evident, emphasizing
  the need for targeted policy interventions to address these disparities.
