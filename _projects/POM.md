  This study examines the consumption expenditure inquality across social groups of various
 states in India to analyze the disparities in the consumption of resouces using MPCE. The Gini
 coefficient, a key indicator of economic inequality is calculated. Our findings reveal significant
 variations in income inequality across states, with Maharashtra exhibiting the highest Gini coeffi
cient at 0.3692, followed by Chhattisgarh (0.3571) and Haryana (0.3516). Conversely, states such
 as Manipur and Tripura demonstrate lower levels of inequality, with Gini coefficients of 0.2405 and
 0.2408, respectively. Also within states there is considereation variation amongs different caste,
 highlighting the homogenity of lower expenditure group. The uneven distribution of wealth and
 resources across castes is evident, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions to address
 these disparities.
