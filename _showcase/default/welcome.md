# **Showcase: My Work & Research**

Over the years, I have worked on **diverse projects**, ranging from **COVID-19 prediction, MRI segmentation, large-scale surveys, deep learning applications**, and **statistical modeling**. This space will serve as a **repository of my research, experiments, and insights**, where I will be compiling and sharing the materials I have used in my journey.

* where I plan to demonstrate these models and share my insights.

## **Upcoming Work**
- ðŸ“Œ I am currently compiling **all my Jupyter/R notebooks** and will upload them soon.
- ðŸ“Œ I am curating a **playlist of statistical modeling resources**, covering various **theoretical and applied methods**.
- ðŸ“Œ I plan to analyze and explain **interesting papers** I have come across in my reading.

This showcase is a **work in progress**, and I hope to build a **comprehensive repository** of my research, simulations, and findings. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
