        Over the years, I have worked on <strong>diverse projects</strong>, ranging from <strong>COVID-19 prediction, MRI segmentation, large-scale surveys, deep learning applications</strong>, and <strong>statistical modeling</strong>. This space will serve as a <strong>repository of my research, experiments, and insights</strong>, where I will be compiling and sharing the materials I have used in my journey.
