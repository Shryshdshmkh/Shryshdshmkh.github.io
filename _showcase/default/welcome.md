# **Showcase: My Work & Research**

Over the years, I have worked on **diverse projects**, ranging from **COVID-19 prediction, MRI segmentation, large-scale surveys, deep learning applications**, and **statistical modeling**. This space will serve as a **repository of my research, experiments, and insights**, where I will be compiling and sharing the materials I have used in my journey.

## **Machine Learning in COVID-19 Risk Prediction**
I explored the **RF-SLAM** machine learning approach to develop **SCARP** in the Indian context. We had limited data from two hospitals and aimed to leverage newly developed methodologies to create a **risk calculator for predicting severe illness or mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients**. We considered **105 variables** as inputs into the **RF-SLAM predictive algorithm**, leveraging **ensemble learning** and **random survival forests** to analyze right-censored survival data with time-varying covariates. Risk predictions were derived using **ensemble hazard rates** from the **Bayes estimate of the event rate**, implemented via a modified version of the **randomForestSRC package in R**. This project was never finished, but I have substantial work related to it that could be valuable for future young researchers.

## **Meta-Analysis on COVID-19 Vaccines**
In 2022, I attempted to perform a **meta-analysis on COVID-19 vaccines**. I created a **template and an R program** for this study, but since the required data has not yet been released, I had to abandon it. However, I explored the topic using **simulated data generated from previous vaccine clinical trial behaviors**. I will upload all the data and programs, as I am currently focusing on different areas.

## **Deep Learning & Statistical Modeling**
My work also includes **MRI segmentation using deep learning**, where I experimented with **CNNs and transformer-based architectures** for medical image analysis. Additionally, I have conducted **large-scale simulation studies** for my **published research**, tackling complex methodological challenges in **quantile regression, time series forecasting, and survival analysis**.

## **Spatial & Spatiotemporal Modeling**
I have also worked on replicating **papers on spatial and spatiotemporal models** using **R and Python**. This process enriched my experience and learning. I am currently working on a **blog** where I plan to demonstrate these models and share my insights.

## **Upcoming Work**
- ðŸ“Œ I am currently compiling **all my Jupyter/R notebooks** and will upload them soon.
- ðŸ“Œ I am curating a **playlist of statistical modeling resources**, covering various **theoretical and applied methods**.
- ðŸ“Œ I plan to analyze and explain **interesting papers** I have come across in my reading.

This showcase is a **work in progress**, and I hope to build a **comprehensive repository** of my research, simulations, and findings. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
